# Kosaraju

Implementation of Kosaraju' algorithm for finding strongly connected components in a directed graph, a set of components such that there exists a path between all pairs of vertices bidirectionallly.

### Sample Run (Input Data in TestKosarajuSCC.java)

9 strongly connected components

Component 1: 2 5 6 8 9 11 12 13 15 16 18 19 21 22 23 25 26 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 37 38 39 40 42 43 44 46 47 48 49 

Component 2: 41 

Component 3: 7 

Component 4: 3 4 17 20 24 27 36 

Component 5: 14 

Component 6: 45 

Component 7: 1 

Component 8: 0
